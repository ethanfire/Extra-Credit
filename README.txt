1) To run this code please do the following:
	0- This project uses Visual Studio! Please download visual studio to view this assignment if you don't already have it.
	1- Download the repository locally.
	2- Open up the Project1 folder which contains the C++ assignment files.
	3- Click on Project1.sln - ideally, this will open in a current version of Visual Studio.
		3.1- Alternatively, I believe opening Project1.vcxproj works as well
	4- Make sure main.cpp is open
	5- At the top of the screen, click debug > start without debugging
	6- The console will have everything you need to finish testing the code, enjoy!

2) This assignment needs some standardization to become an "official" assignment in the future. I say this because I can only imagine
grading this for the whole class would be a nightmare. Each student turning in different types of files with different expectations on
what the grader is required to do to view the assignment. I think a way to grade worth investigating a little more would be requiring
students to record a video showcasing their code and certain edge cases, and uploading this video ALONG with their code and instructions to run.
A short 1-2 minute video would be appropriate for this. 

Personal NIT: I don't think requiring exceptions is good practice. This assignment is able to be done without exceptions while still
preventing an error being thrown and user experience being interrupted so abruptly. It adds to the critical thinking of solving
the assignment's challenges to not throw exceptions.
